I am presenting at [Wiki Workshop 2023](https://wikiworkshop.org/2023/) on May 11! My talk, based on some ongoing work, is titled: “Governance Capture in A Self-Governing Community,” and is a qualitative interview study diving deep into the institutional and organizational factors that led to the capture of Croatian Wikipedia’s governance mechanisms by a group of far-right editors.
