Are you an organizer of an online group/community thinking through governance strategies for resisting online information manipulation? Join my research group for our next [Community Dialogue](https://wiki.communitydata.science/The_Role_of_Community_Governance) on Friday, April 4th (12pm-2pm CT), with Paul Gowder, Professor of Law at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law and author of [The Networked Leviathan: For Democratic Platforms](https://networked-leviathan.com/), and me! 

I am very excited to present some ongoing (and upcoming) research on governing public goods in increasingly adversarial information environments. Prof. Gowder will talk about the promise of multi-level governance of platforms, and how to move toward the simultaneous democratization of platforms and the re-democratization of the United States. 

There will be plenty of time for discussion/q&a. Register to attend [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfC8ByIxY3TIyM-fpN-yYxov37Qf0IBIYessA3-PgH62ocydw/viewform).
